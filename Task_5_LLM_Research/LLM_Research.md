# Large Language Models

1. What is an LLM?
A Large Language Model is an artificial intelligence model trained on large amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.
2. How LLMs Work
- Text is broken into tokens
- Transformer neural networks process the tokens
- Model predicts next words based on probability
3. Deploying LLMs Locally
Popular tools:
- Ollama
- LM Studio
- llama.cpp
- Text-Generation-WebUI
4. Hardware Requirements
- CPU: Works but slower
- GPU: Faster inference (NVIDIA rec)
# Example Command
bash
ollama run llama2

5. Use Cases
- Chatbots
- Code generation
- Education
- Healthcare
